# Permit Management System - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Java Home Path Configuration Issue
**Problem**: The `gradle.properties` file contained hardcoded Java home paths that were incompatible with Docker Alpine Linux containers.

**Solution**: 
- Removed hardcoded `org.gradle.java.home` paths from `gradle.properties`
- Updated Dockerfile to explicitly set `JAVA_HOME=/opt/java/openjdk` for Alpine containers
- Added debugging information to Dockerfile build process

### 2. Homebrew JDK Compatibility Issue
**Problem**: Compose Multiplatform packaging was rejecting Homebrew's JDK distribution.

**Solution**: 
- Added `compose.desktop.packaging.checkJdkVendor=false` to `gradle.properties`

### 3. macOS Timeout Command Issue
**Problem**: The deployment script used `timeout` command which doesn't exist on macOS by default.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `deploy-desktop-app.sh` to check for `gtimeout` (from coreutils) or `timeout`
- Added fallback for macOS without coreutils

## Current Status

### âœ… Working Components

1. **Backend Server (Docker)**
   - Successfully builds and deploys
   - API endpoints working (tested: http://localhost:8081/counties)
   - Database and Redis containers running
   - Nginx reverse proxy configured
   - SSL certificates generated

2. **Desktop Application**
   - Successfully builds for macOS
   - DMG installer created: `composeApp/build/compose/binaries/main/dmg/com.regnowsnaes.permitmanagementsystem-1.0.0.dmg`
   - Application bundle available in: `composeApp/build/compose/binaries/main/app/`

### ðŸ”„ Components Not Yet Tested

1. **Android Application**
   - Build process not completed (requires signing key setup)
   - Android SDK detected and configured

2. **Development Environment Setup**
   - Not tested in this session

## Access Information

- **Web Application**: http://localhost:8081
- **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:8081/admin  
- **API Endpoint**: http://localhost:8081/counties
- **Desktop App**: Install from DMG file or run from app bundle

## Management Commands

- Start system: `./start-server.sh`
- Stop system: `./stop-server.sh`
- Check status: `./status-server.sh`
- Monitor system: `./monitor-system.sh`
- Backup system: `./backup-system.sh`
- System dashboard: `./manage-system.sh`

## Next Steps

1. Test the web application functionality
2. Complete Android application build (generate signing keys)
3. Test desktop application functionality
4. Configure external access if needed
5. Set up production SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt)

## Files Modified

- `gradle.properties` - Removed hardcoded Java paths, added Compose Desktop config
- `Dockerfile.production` - Added explicit JAVA_HOME setting and debugging
- `deploy-desktop-app.sh` - Fixed timeout command for macOS compatibility

The system is now successfully deployed and the main issues have been resolved!
