- **Production Backend**: Running and accessible

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### Start Android Studio
```bash
~/start-android-studio.sh
```

### Start Android Emulator
```bash
~/start-android-emulator.sh
```

### Check ADB Devices
```bash
adb devices
```

### Test Mobile Setup
```bash
./test-mobile-setup.sh
```

## 📱 Building the Mobile Apps

### Option 1: Android Studio (Recommended)
1. **Launch Android Studio**:
   ```bash
   ~/start-android-studio.sh
   ```

2. **Open Project**:
   - Click "Open an Existing Project"
   - Navigate to `/home/archie/codebase/permitmanagementsystem`
   - Select the project folder

3. **Let Android Studio Configure**:
   - Android Studio will automatically detect the Kotlin Multiplatform project
   - It will download any missing dependencies
   - Wait for indexing to complete

4. **Build and Run**:
   - Select "composeApp" from the run configuration dropdown
   - Choose your target (Android emulator or connected device)
   - Click the green "Run" button

### Option 2: Command Line (Advanced)
The command line build currently has Java toolchain detection issues. This is a common problem that can be resolved by:

1. **Using Gradle Properties**:
   ```bash
   echo "org.gradle.java.home=/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64" >> gradle.properties
   ```

2. **Or using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition** (free alternative to Android Studio)
